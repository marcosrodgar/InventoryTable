Steps to run the web page solution:

1. Open the file 'InventoryTable.sln' 
2. Nuget may need to install some dependencies, once those are installed two web browsers should open: one with the API's swagger page
and another with the actual table UI.
3. The table UI will present a loading message while the backend service spins up, once the backend is started, you may need to refresh to
get the table rendered.
